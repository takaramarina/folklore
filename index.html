  <p>
		1. Maybe a quick introduction first?
  </p>
  <p>
    Hello. My name is Marina, and I like making art. Lately,
    I've been exploring several themes: first, the use
    of technology in art, both as a medium and as a platform
    for archives (and what is the difference?), 
    and second, the relationship between light
    and shadow-focused art in Europe and America vs the line-
    centered art from Japan, and how this reflects the cultural
    beliefs of each nation, from the binary Christianity of
    the European and American countries to Shintoism and 
    cram culture in Japan. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is my way of tracking my progress and the 
    things that I deemed to be worthy of my artistic 
    expression at various stages of my life. I think that 
    it will be interesting to see how I've changed over
    the past two decades of my life... but I guess we
    will find out!
  </p>

  <p>
    2. Who run the world?
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="1.jpg" alt="drawing">
    As we all do (?), I started with drawing girls. I was
    in this phase for quite a long time (and to be honest,
    I still enjoy it from time to time), and you can see that
    I was really loving the front and center, cuteness-focused
    portrait style of drawing, simply because I could focus
    on drawing the cutest girls possible. I think that these
    range from elementary and junior high school, with the
    bottom right one being the most recent done in my first
    or second year of high school. I was really pleased with
    these at the time because art was a way for me to draw
    pretty things and confirm that I can control a pencil,
    paintbrush, or stylus at my will.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started getting a little bored after a few years since
    I was not really changing anything about the pieces other
    than my subject matter, so I was eager to explore what
    other things I could draw.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. ...or paint.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="paintings.JPG" alt="drawing">
    A pivotal point of my life was when I received oil paints
    from an anonymous donor (my dad) and I was introduced to 
    the world of painting. Of course, I had painted before, but
    it was all kind of minor stuff, but now, I was prepared to
    create Masterpieces. I was still in junior high/high school
    at this time, and I had a lot of free time, so I was creating
    at a pretty high pace, but I never had enough canvases, so I
    always painted over an existing canvas to create more space
    for the new visions in my head.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really liked these paintings, but as mentioned before,
    I wasn't particularly attached to any of them since I was
    creating them under the impression that I would be painting
    over them at a later date. But it still kind of sucked when
    I gave some of them to my boyfriend at the time, who then
    turned into a crazy stalker ex after we broke up.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="COB.JPEG" alt="drawing">
    This is another painting that I did (titled "Chicken or beef")
    , and while I liked how
    it turned out, I was frustrated with the level of detail
    that I was unable to get because of the thickness of both
    the oil paint and my cheap brush that I was using. Rather 
    than spending time developing my oil paint skills or 
    investing in a new brush, I decided to go a different route
    for my next fixation on art.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Into the digital world.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="b&w.JPG" alt="drawing">
    This piece was the first piece I did digitally
    (other than the girl at the bottom right in section 2, 
    which I'm pretty sure I did with my fingers on my phone
    so it doesn't count), and I used a drawing tablet with a
    stylus attached to my computer along with Adobe Photoshop.
    My goal was to see exactly how much detail I could get 
    through a digital artscape, and I was pleased to discover
    that there was hardly a limit. The red line was added at
    the very end after several people told me that they thought
    they were just looking at a black and white photograph.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this piece, I was still using art as a way to fine-tune
    my core skills - how close can I get my end result to look
    like the reference picture I found on Pinterest? But after
    its completion, I felt rather satisfied with that, and
    started thinking about where I could go with art in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that piece, there's a pause in my visual art production
    for about a year for two reasons: first, I was creating
    fashion pieces because I was thinking of pursuing a fashion
    degree in college, and second, that was the final piece
    in my visual art portfolio I was going to send to colleges,
    so I was feeling a little burnt out. Art is really the best
    when you're doing it for yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Go explore some lines.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="lines.jpg" alt="drawing">
    Coinciding with my search for artistic expression outside
    of realism, I started researching the emergence of mycology
    in Japan from the late 19th to early 20th century. This
    sounds fancy, but all it means is that I looked at a bunch
    of articles about mushrooms and fungi, and this really fueled
    my interest in "gross" looking things, a stark contrast to
    the beauty-centered art I was previously creating. I also
    started getting into non-flat canvases, which is just a 
    nice, parent-friendly way of saying that I got into tattoos.
    Dear family, if you're reading this, I have no tattoos.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I was less pleased with the final outcome of these
    pieces, I really enjoyed the fact that they allowed me to 
    explore a new artistic venue, especially the exploration
    of lines as the focal form. Growing up in America, I never
    fully realized the extent of light and shadow I always implemented
    into my works, but over this period, I started to recognize
    the line-focused art created in Japan and its stark contrast
    with foreign art.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Finger.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="lines.jpg" alt="drawing">
    I was tired of the commitment of sitting down with the intent
    to create a masterpiece, so I got into drawing on my phone.
  </p>
